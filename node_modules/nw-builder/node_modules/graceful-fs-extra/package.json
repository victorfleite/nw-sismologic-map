This protects you against `EMFILE` errors when opening too many files, etc.\n\n**Note**: this is a temporary solution until [jprichardson/node-fs-extra#95](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/95) is resolved.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install graceful-fs-extra`\n\n## API\n\nThe exact same as [node-fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra)'s.\n",
